My approach here is, too traverse over all cells that are sea and count
for each cell how much coast it has around it.

I start by collecting all cells that are at the border and put them in a queue,
if the are water. If they are land, i count it as coast.
Then i start popping from the q. For every cell i count how much land is around
it -> km of coast line. Then i add every neighbor, that is water, 
also to the q if i wasn't visited yet. Until the queue is empty,
every sea cell has been visited exactly once.
